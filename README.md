# GitHub-Code-Search-Hacking
This is an index of search queries (dorks) used to find secrets and credentials within GitHub, intended for pentesters and security researchers.

# Introduction
With the introduction of GitHub Code Search in March 2023 it’s now possible to search through  code from repositories by using more powerful queries, which support regular expressions. You can use different scopes for a search, such as: repository,  organization or even all of GitHub. Even though this search functionality has it [limitations](https://docs.github.com/en/search-github/github-code-search/about-github-code-search#limitations), it is still a powerful tool that can be used to search for specific strings. Strings which may contain secrets. And thus this functionality can be used to find secrets. The GitHub dorks in this repository can be used to find secrets. 

# Dorks
You can find GitHub dorks in the `github-dorks.md` file.
